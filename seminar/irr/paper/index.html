<p class="essayTitle">Price Increases in the United States Insulin Market: A Political Analysis of Potential Causes and Policy Solutions</p>
<b>Introduction</b>
  <p>The inaffordability of insulin has become a prevalent problem in the United States (US). According to Gotham, of London Imperial College’s Faculty of Medicine, “half of [those who need insulin] do not have reliable, affordable access to the medicine” (Gotham, 2018). Cefalu, chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, notes that “prices of insulin over the past two decades... nearly tripled between 2002 and 2013” (Cefalu, 2018). There are three major causes of the prices that patients often must pay for their needed medicine. First, the US has only three major suppliers of insulin, creating an oligopoly in the market. Second, there is little public knowledge on how money is dealt within the insulin market, largely in part due to the lack of transparency laws mandating that those within the supply chain disclose their dealings, according to a cross-sectional study on transparency laws by Ryan of the Sol Price School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California (Ryan, 2019). Third, patients are often uninformed on the options available to them, and end up spending more than they need to, according to Gogineni of the USA University of Health Sciences Department of Pharmacy Practice and Administration (Gogineni, 2018).</p>
<br>
  
<b>Monopoly of the Market</b>
  <p>There are only three major insulin producers in the US, those being Novo Nordisk, Sanofi-Aventis, and Eli Lilly. Due to this lack of competition in the market, prices can be increased without patients being able to switch to a more affordable insulin producer. Although at first glance this issue seems economic in nature, the roots of the virtual monopoly in the insulin market are political. According to Greene of thr New England Journal of Medicine, the US pharmaceutical market operates largely on a model of giving drugs a short window of patent protection under which the inventor can make a profit, and then having the patent expire, at which point generics are produced (Greene, 2015). Insulin was initially quite limited, requiring many injections per day and having impurities that could cause side effects; innovations improved the medication, but they also "extended the reach of insulin patents" (Greene, 2015). With each improvement that was made, a new patent was filed, and thus patent protection continued on the life-saving medication. Furthermore, according to Rakjumar, a researcher at Mayo Clinic, "pharmaceutical companies have resorted to filing and securing multiple patents on the same drug," such as the "70 patents... filed for Lantus" (Rakjumar, 2020). Such tactics can extend patent life and by proxy monopoly protection on insulin for many years. According to Gotham, if biosimilars (i.e. generics) were introduced to the market, they coukd be sold of $72-133 less than non-generics (Gotham, 2018). But this cannot occur until it is possible for generics to enter the market.</p>

<b>Lack of Patient Knowledge</b>
  <p>At the individual patient level, there is a lack of knowledge on the insulin that is prescribed and purchased. There are two main types of insulin: regular human insulin (RHI), and synthetic, or analog, insulin. The differences between the two are not major, and according to Dr. Davidson, a Professor of Medicine at Charles Drew University and the David Geffen School of Medicine who has presented hundreds of lectures on the subject, "regular [human] insulin is just as effective as the rapid-acting insulin analogs" (Davidson, 2014). Patients can treat their diabetes with either RHI or analogss without significant difference in treatment. However, analogs are far more expensive than RHI (Davidson, 2014). This would suggest that most patients would buy RHI instead of analogs, but according to Dr. Wirtz of the Department for Global Health and Development at Boston University, "[p]ercentage analogue [sic] insulin consumption increases over time... from about 32 percent to nearly 80 percent between 2004 and 2014" (Wirtz, 2016). Despite the only major difference between RHI and analog being that analog is more expensive, patients are increasingly buying analogs over RHI. The cause of this may be the lack of patient education from pharmacists, who are "in a prime position to educate patients... about the costs, advantages and disadvantages of various insulin formulations" (Gogineni, 2018). </p>

<b>Lack of Supply Chain Transparency</b>
  <p>Although the monopoly in the insulin market and the lack of patient education contribute to the rise in insulin prices, it cannot be said with certainty that these are the main factors. In order to fully understand what policy failures have led to rising insulin prices, it is important to also analyze the insulin market and what policies allow the price of insulin to increase. The list price of insulin is defined as the price set by the manufacturer, and the net price is defined as the money the manufacturer actually makes, that being the list price minus any discounts and rebates paid by the manufacturer (Cefalu, 2018). One might expect that, as the list price rises, the net price would rise at more or less the same rate, but in reality, “the net price to the insulin manufacturers has grown at a slower rate, or has gone down, compared to list prices” (Cefalu, 2018). This creates a gap between the list price and the net price, and by proxy, diminishing returns to the manufacturer. These diminishing returns necessitate that manufacturers raise prices in order to continue making profit. That manufacturers are not benefitting from the increase in price, but only making up for losses, raises the question of what part of the supply chain is benefitting.</p>

  <p>In order to determine who is benefitting from increased insulin prices, it is necessary to analyze the insulin supply chain. Generally, the medicine is sold directly down the supply chain, from manufacturer to wholesaler to pharmacy to patient, and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate monetary benefits to pharmacies between pharmacies, insurers, and manufacturers; PBMs charge fees, called rebates, for their services (Figure 1). Due to this complex system, it is difficult to pinpoint who exactly benefits from increased prices. This problem is compounded by the lack of transparency within the supply chain, meaning that, according to Ryna, "few people outside of the pharmaceutical industry know which supply chain participants are making excess profits and where to target policy solutions" (Ryan, 2019). Ryan found in her cross-sectional study that "only 7 [transparency] laws passed in 6 states [are] informative" (Ryan, 2019). Thus, parts of the insulin supply chain are allowed to remain secretive about their dealings, preventing insight into potential solutions. According to Luo of the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, "transparency measures would... make data available to design future reforms," but it is important to note that transparency laws would be "unlikely to substantially reduce insulin prices in the USA by themselves," as they allow insight into the market, but don't directly regulate it (Luo, 2017). The lack of transparency laws is therefore not so much a cause of high insulin prices as it is an enabler for the cause to continue.</p>
