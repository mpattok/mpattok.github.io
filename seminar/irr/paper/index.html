<p class="essayTitle">A Political Analysis of Price Gouging in the Insulin Market</p>
<b>Introduction</b>
<p>News of the inaffordability of insulin has become a prevalent problem in the US. According to Gotham, of London Imperial College’s Faculty of Medicine, “half of [those who need insulin] do not have reliable, affordable access to the medicine” (Gotham, 2018). William Cefalu, chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, notes in his paper on insulin price that “list prices of insulin over the past two decades... nearly tripled between 2002 and 2013” (Cefalu, 2018). The list price of insulin is defined as the price set by manufacturers, and the net price is defined as what is actually paid for the medication, the net price being the list price minus discounts and rebates paid by the manufacturer to pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, who manage the pharmacy benefits of health plans for their clients (Cefalu, 2018). There are three major causes of the prices that patients often must pay for their needed medicine. First, the US has only three major suppliers of insulin, creating an oligopoly in the market. Second, there is little public knowledge on how money is dealt within the insulin market, largely in part due to the lack of transparency laws mandating that those within the market disclose their dealings (Ryan, 2019). Third, patients are often uninformed on the options and programs available to them, and end up spending more than they need to, according to Gogineni of the USA University of Health Sciences Department of Pharmacy Practice and Administration (Gogineni, 2018).</p>
