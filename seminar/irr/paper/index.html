<p class="essayTitle">Price Increases in the United States Insulin Market: A Political Analysis of Potential Causes and Policy Solutions</p>
<b>Introduction</b>
<p>The inaffordability of insulin has become a prevalent problem in the United States (US). According to Gotham, of London Imperial College’s Faculty of Medicine, “half of [those who need insulin] do not have reliable, affordable access to the medicine” (Gotham, 2018). Cefalu, chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, notes that “prices of insulin over the past two decades... nearly tripled between 2002 and 2013” (Cefalu, 2018). There are three major causes of the prices that patients often must pay for their needed medicine. First, the US has only three major suppliers of insulin, creating an oligopoly in the market. Second, there is little public knowledge on how money is dealt within the insulin market, largely in part due to the lack of transparency laws mandating that those within the supply chain disclose their dealings, according to a cross-sectional study on transparency laws by Ryan of the Sol Price School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California (Ryan, 2019). Third, patients are often uninformed on the options and programs available to them, and end up spending more than they need to, according to Gogineni of the USA University of Health Sciences Department of Pharmacy Practice and Administration (Gogineni, 2018).</p>
