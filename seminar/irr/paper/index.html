<p class="essayTitle">Price Increases in the United States Insulin Market: A Political Analysis of Potential Causes and Policy Solutions</p>
<b>Introduction</b>
  <p>The inaffordability of insulin has become a prevalent problem in the United States (US). According to Gotham, of London Imperial College’s Faculty of Medicine, “half of [those who need insulin] do not have reliable, affordable access to the medicine” (Gotham, 2018). Cefalu, chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, notes that “prices of insulin over the past two decades... nearly tripled between 2002 and 2013” (Cefalu, 2018). There are three major causes of the prices that patients often must pay for their needed medicine. First, the US has only three major suppliers of insulin, creating an oligopoly in the market. Second, there is little public knowledge on how money is dealt within the insulin market, largely in part due to the lack of transparency laws mandating that those within the supply chain disclose their dealings, according to a cross-sectional study on transparency laws by Ryan of the Sol Price School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California (Ryan, 2019). Third, patients are often uninformed on the options and programs available to them, and end up spending more than they need to, according to Gogineni of the USA University of Health Sciences Department of Pharmacy Practice and Administration (Gogineni, 2018).</p>

<b>Lack of Supply Chain Transparency</b>
  <p>The list price of insulin is defined as the price set by the manufacturer, and the net price is defined as the money the manufacturer actually makes, that being the list price minus any discounts and rebates paid by the manufacturer (Cefalu, 2018). One might expect that as the list price rises, the net price would rise at more or less the same rate, but in reality, “the net price to the insulin manufacturers has grown at a slower rate, or has gone down, compared to list prices” (Cefalu, 2018). This creates a gap between the list price and the net price, and by proxy, diminishing returns to the manufacturer. These diminishing returns necessitate that manufacturers raise prices in order to continue making profit. That manufacturers are not benefitting from the increase in price, but only making up for losses, raises the question of what part of the supply chain is benefitting.</p>

  <p>In order to determine who is benefitting from increased insulin prices, it is necessary to analyze the insulin supply chain. Generally, the medicine is sold directly down the supply chain, from manufacturer to wholesaler to pharmacy to patient, and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate monetary benefits to pharmacies between pharmacies, insurers, and manufacturers; PBMs charge fees, called rebates, for their services (Figure 1). </p>
