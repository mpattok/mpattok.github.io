<td>The paper analyses reasons for opposition to unions, concluding that the "managerial ideology" of managers wanting control over workers leads to them seeking to prevent union formation. To circumvent this, the paper says that workers who wish to be protected by unions must engage in discourse that speaks for the workers.</td>
