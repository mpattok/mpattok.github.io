        <h3>Compiler Directives</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>#import</td>
                <td>Make the names of a source or binary file visible to the program, or make an interface file visible.<br>
                    The formatting of the name given to the directive tells the compiler where to find the file:<br>
                    <span class="snip">#import &lt;stdlib&gt;</span> stdlib is in the standard library<br>
                    <span class="snip">#import [tree.tli]</span> tree is a user-installed package<br>
                    <span class="snip">#import "my_lib.tl"</span> the file to import is located at the given location (relative to the source file)<br>
                    Some additional parameters can be given after the file name when importing source or binary files:<br>
                    <span class="snip">#import "my_lib.tl" in my_module</span> the file names will be wrapped in a module of the supplied name. If the file contains only one module, with no names outside that module, it will be imported as normal but with the name of the module changed.<br>
                    <span class="snip">#import "my_lib.tl" for "my_interface.tl"</span> only the names in the file which are required by the interface will be made visible. Compilation fails if the file does not have the names necessary to implement the interface (or if it is a single-module file, if that module cannot implement the interface). No effect if the file is a single-module file which is already declared to implement the given interface. Instead of a .tli file, the supplied parameter can be the name of an already-visible interface.<br>
                    <span class="snip">#import "my_lib.tl" > my_func, my_type only make the given names visible. If the file is a single module or if the file is opened in a module, this does not open the module-- it is still necessary to reference the module name before the funcion name, e.g. <span class="snip">my_lib.my_func</span><br>
                    All of these additional parameters may be present, but the name specifier must come last if it is present, e.g. <span class="snip">#import &lt;stdlib&gt; in std for "my_std.tli" > printf</span> is valid, but <span class="snip">#import &lt;stdlib&gt; in std > printf for "my_std.tli"</span> is not.

To open a file, it must be imported first.</td>

The supplied program parameter must be a Timl source file or a binary file (in the former case, the source file will be interpreted). The program must take a source file as input and give a source file as output. The format to specify the program is the same as for an import directive. This directive allows for the compiler to be extended in a modular way.</td>
