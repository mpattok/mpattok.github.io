  <b>What is the Stroop Effect?</b>
    <br>
    The Stroop Effect is the delay between reaction time when different stimuli from something don't match (these stimuli are called <b>incongruent</b>). In this experiment, which is an example of a Stroop Test, the color of the text and the actual word spelling out a color name are the two stimuli. In the first set, the name and actual color match, so there is no incongruence (the stimuli are <b>congruent</b>). As a result, our brains have no trouble identifying the color of the font, because there is no contradictory information. Our <b>top-down perception</b> (the reading of the word) does not conflict with our <b>bottom-up sensation</b> (the registering of the color).
